    "* NumPy: Numerical Python (NumPy) is the foundation package. Other packages and libraries are built on top of NumPy. \n",
    "* pandas: Provides data structures and processing capabilities similar to ones found in R and Excel. Also provides time series capabilities.\n",
    "* SciPy: Collection of packages to tackle a number of computing problems in data analytics, statistics, and linear algebra.\n",
    "* matplotlib: Plotting library. Allows to plot a number of 2D graphs and will serve as primary graphics library.\n",
    "* IPython: Interactive Python shell that allows quick prototyping of code. \n",
    "* Statsmodels: Allows data analysis, statistical model estimation, statistical tests, and regressions, and function plotting. \n",
    "* BeautifulSoup: Python library for crawling the web. Allows you to pull data from HTML and XML pages. \n",

    "**Introduction to NumPy**\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (short form for Numerical Python) is the most fundamental package designed for scientific computing and data analysis. Most of the other packages such as pandas, statsmodels are built on top of it, and is an important package to know and learn about. At the heart of NumPy is a data structure called **ndarray**. ndarray is a basically a multi-dimensional array that is built specifically for the purpose of numerical data analysis. Python also has array capabilities, but they are more generic. The advantage of using ndarray is that processing is extremely efficient and fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform standard mathematical operations on either individual elements or complete array. The range of functions covered is linear algebra, statistical operations, and other specialized mathematical operations. For our purpose, we need to know about ndarray and the range of mathematical functions that are relevant to our research purpose. If you already know languages such as C, Fortran, then you can integrate NumPy code with code written in these languages and can pass NumPy arrays seamlessly. \n",
    "\n",
    "From an overall perspective, understanding of NumPy will help us in using pandas effectively as it is built on top of NumPy and frequently we will also be using functions of NumPy in research work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible application of NumPy package in research work are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Algorithmic operations such as sorting, grouping and set operations\n",
    "+ Performing repetitive operations on whole arrays of data without using loops\n",
    "+ Data merging and alignment operations\n",
    "+ Data indexing, filtering, and transformation on individual elements or whole arrays\n",
    "+ Data summarization and descriptive statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing NumPy**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to check if NumPy is installed, go to Package Manager and type NumPy. You will get a list of packages with names closely matching to NumPy. For our purpose, we need to focus on package named numpy 1.xx. If the package is not installed, click on Install. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing NumPy**\n",
