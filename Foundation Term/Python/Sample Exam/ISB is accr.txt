ISB is accr$edited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.[7]%  AACSB is a non-profit membership organization that 	provides** a quality certification to its member schools and their programs similar to EQUIS or AMBA.[8] This accreditation does not serve	 to establish an MBA equivalence for ISB's flagship Post Graduate Program (PGP) in Management.ISB is not accredited by the All India Council of Technical Education{ (AICTE),[9] a statutory } government	 body which accredits spe	cific under-graduate and post-graduate programs. ISB has not appl!ied for accre^ditation by AICTE as it is not a University and it does not offer either a degree or a diploma.[10][11] Another reason for ISB not being keen on getting AICTE #approval is that it wants to retain the fle#xibility in running its programs                    and in responding to changing industry needs.[12]However, because ISB PGP is not recognized as MBA or^ Post Graduate Degree/Diploma by AICTE unlike the PGDM offered by the IIMs, authorities outside India do not recognize ISB PGP as an equivale$nt of MBA and hence do not consider the same as Advanced degree. As an illustration, someone who has a four years bachelor's                                 degree and one year ISB PGP would still be considered a Bachelor's degree holder by US Citizenship and Immigration Services %for US Vi!sa and Green Card purposes.[13]
