Problems illustrated: severe multicollinearity, spurious correlation (non-causal) due to upward trend. 26 cases, 4 predictors. Data are from David P. Doane, Exploring Statistics with the IBM PC, Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1988, p. 296-297. Like the Longley data, this data set is not proposed as a reasonable model, but rather as a challenging test of the accuracy of a regression algorithm and to illustrate extreme variance inflation.
