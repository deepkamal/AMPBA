"Fuel Economy "
" An auto company is studying the fuel economy of the Zebra 501GT, a new vehicle with a low-emissions engine. In preliminary tests, the car averaged 25.4 miles per gallon (mpg). The next step is to record data from weekly field tests of a sample of 9 vehicles driven by company employees. Based on the field tests, can the company advertise that the Zebra 501 averages at least 25 mpg?"

"Chemistry Test Results "
"A freshman chemistry instructor gives her class the first exam. For many students this is their first college exam. Although many are anxious, since she has given a version of the test many times over the years, she tells them to study hard but not to worry because the mean will be about 70. No student finishes the exam early. As the papers are collected she tells them that if the average score is below 68 she will give each of them 5 extra points. Was this a rash statement? Would she have made this statement if her class had been one quarter the size? Why or why not?"

"GMAT Verbal and Quantitative Scores"
"The GMAT is a test given to students applying to enter MBA programs. One year the average verbal score was 27 and quantitative score was 31. If on a particular day that year an admissions officer received applications from 2 students, is it likely (occurs more than 10% of the time) that the average verbal score was greater than the average quantitative score? On another day 16 applications are received, is it likely that the average verbal score was greater than the average quantitative score? What about in the 200 who were accepted (assume this school accepts average MBA applicants)?"

"Two Different Fruit Sorters"
"A fruit packing plant needs to buy a machine to sort fruit by size and condition. Company A's machine will sort 100 pieces of fruit in 20 seconds with a standard deviation of 4 seconds. Company B's machine will sort 100 pieces of fruit in 21 seconds with a standard deviation of 1 second. If the two machines are the same price, which should the company buy? How many hundred pieces of fruit must be sorted before the decision is very clear?"

"Pizza Delivery"
"A pizza store advertises for college students to deliver pizzas. The ad says drivers earn $9 an hour plus tips. When you apply for the job you find out that the company pays $3 per delivery The owner says that Saturday night deliveries average 20 minutes (round trip) with some taking less time and others much more. Seeing a worried look on your face, he tells you that the length of time to deliver three pizzas (average number per hour) is normally distributed. Why would the time it takes to deliver pizzas have a skewed distribution? Is the time needed to deliver three pizzas normally distributed? Why or why not? Do drivers make average $9 per hour?"

"Two Truck Drivers"
"A delivery company keeps track of the number of deliveries each driver makes per week. Two buddies have different driving styles. Larry on average makes 45 deliveries per week, while Fritz averages 47. However, Fritz has a much wider variation in the weekly number of deliveries. After observing 4 weeks, is it clear which driver you would rather have on your staff? After observing 50 weeks? After 100 weeks?"

"Random Number"
"A statistics instructor has every student use a calculator to find a random number between 0 and 2. He says that the class average will be between 0.9 and 1.1. To reinforce his point, he says he will wager $10 to any student's $1 that he is correct. If the class has 100 students, should a student take the wager? Was it possible for the instructor to lose? Why or why not?"
