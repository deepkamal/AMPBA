"Green Light"
"Based on Dave's experience there is a 60 percent chance of a green light on westbound Walton at Adams Road at 4 PM. Assuming a Binomial distribution, if Dave commutes this route 23 times what is the chance of hitting all 23 green lights? At least 20?  At least 15? 10 or fewer? Find the mean and mode. Does this distribution resemble a normal? A Poisson?"

"Heart Transplant Rejection"
"The probability of a heart transplant rejection during the first year is 19 percent A hospital performs 30 heart transplants in a particular year. Assuming a Binomial distribution, what is the chance of no rejections?  Fewer than 5?  At least 10? Find the mean, mode, and median. Does this distribution resemble a normal? A Poisson?
