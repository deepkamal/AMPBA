"Exam Scores of Men and Women"
"After an instructor gives an exam in a statistics class he is interested in testing the old belief that men do better in quantitative classes. He believes that the exam scores are normally distributed and probably have the same variance. Do the men score better than the women? Do they have the same variance?"

"Making Cars"
"A car manufacturer builds a new assembly plant that has two assembly lines. Both lines should produce a car in 24 hours. The plant manager believes that the length of time needed to produce a car is normally distributed and that both assembly lines have the same standard deviation. For 7 days she asks both line foremen to report how long the 10th car produced was on the line. Do both assembly lines produce a car in the same length of time? Do they have the same standard deviation?"

He believes that the exam scores are normally distributed and probably have the same variance. Do the men score better than the women? Do they have the same variance?"
