"Selecting a Second Number"
"A certain game involves choosing two numbers (without replacement) between 1 and 15. The computer chooses the first number and you choose the second. Suppose the computer selects a 1 as the first number (so only the numbers 2 through 15 can be chosen as the second number). Is the population continuous or discrete? What is the probability of choosing each number? What is the shape of the probability distribution?"

"Roulette"
"Roulette is a game of chance where the numbers 0, 00 and 1 through 36 are randomly selected by spinning a wheel. Although there are 38 possibilities the payoff for choosing the winning number is 35 to 1 (your original $1 bet plus $35 more). One casino in order to draw more players has dropped the 00 but kept the same payoff. What is the probability of correctly choosing a number? What are the population values? Is the population continuous or discrete? What is the shape of the probability distribution?"

"Traffic at a Factory Gate"
"A traffic counter keeps track of the number of cars and the time (using a 24 hour clock) that enter or leave a factory gate. The factory operates only one shift, although some personnel are allowed to flex their schedules. Most employees start at 8:30 AM (8.5) and quit at 5:30 PM (17.5). No one starts before 6:30 AM or leaves after 7:30 PM. Some employees leave for lunch and some customers arrive throughout the day. Why could the probability distribution of traffic through the factory gate be trimodal? What is the random variable? What values can occur in the population? Is the population continuous or discrete?"
