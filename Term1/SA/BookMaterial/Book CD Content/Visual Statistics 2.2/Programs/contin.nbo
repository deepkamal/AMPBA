"Carbon Monoxide Level"
"The level of carbon monoxide (CO) in a certain indoor ice rink is normally distributed with a mean of 52 ppm (parts per million) with a standard deviation of 8 ppm. The CO level is monitored at random intervals during matches. About how often will the level violate the OSHA standard of 35 ppm? How often would  you expect the CO level to exceed twice the OSHA standard?  Source: Detroit News, March 5, 1995, p. 1E."

During the year before this policy was enacted the mean fax transmission was 8.2 pages.

"Survey Response Rate"
"A business logistics survey was mailed to a sample of U.S. industrial firms. Half received a postcard in advance saying that a survey would arrive soon. Firms were cross-tabulated into a 2x2 table by response (returned survey, didn't return survey) and prenotification (prenotified, not prenotified). Was response rate independent of prenotification? The chi-square test statistic was 5.420 with d.f. = 1. Source: P. R. Murphy, D. R. Dalenberg, and J. M. Daley, 'Improving Survey Responses with Postcards', Industrial Marketing Management, Vol. 19, No. 4, November, 1990, pp. 349-355."

"A new bumper was designed to reduce damage in low-speed collisions. At the end of a trial period, there were 12 repair incidents on an experimental group of vans with the new bumper and 9 repair incidents in a control group with the old bumper. The standard deviation in repair time was 3.423 days for the experimental group compared to 4.960 days in the control group. Was the variance reduced? The test statistic is F = 0.476 with d.f. = 11,8. Source: Unpublished study by F. G. Willoughby and T. W. Lauer."

"Review Sessions"
"To see whether review sessions help improve exam scores, an intermediate accounting instructor had 42 students attend a review session for one exam but not the other (there were two exams). The standard deviation for review students was 14.3 compared with 13.0 for those who had no review. Did review students have a higher variance than non-review students? The test statistic is F = 1.21 with d.f. = 41,41. Source: R. L. Ott, 'Pretest Reviews in Intermediate Accounting: An Empirical Analysis' Issues in Accounting Education, Vol. 3, No. 2, Fall, 1988, p. 385."

"In July, the daily sockeye salmon fish count at Bonneville Dam fish ladder has a mean of 963 with a standard deviation of 112. Assuming a normal distribution, what is the approximate probability that on a randomly-chosen July day the count will be more than 1100 sockeye salmon? More than 1200? More than 1300? Fewer than 600?
