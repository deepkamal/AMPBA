"Equal Frequencies - Median Split"
"Although investors expect to earn a higher return if they take more risk, wealthy investors may require a higher return for taking the same risk since they have less need to take risk. The percent return (Per) for 30 investors is a function of the risk rating (from 1 to 10) of his/her porfolio (Rsk) and his/her wealth (in thousands of dollars). However, rather than the dollar value of wealth, the investors are divided into two groups, the 15 least wealthy (Wlth1) and the 15 most wealthy (Wlth2).

"Equal Frequencies - Three Binary Variable"
"Checkout scanners cannot always read a bar code. The number of scanning errors (NErr) is a function of the number of items scanned (NScn) and the number of items that have the bar code stamped on plastic wrap (NPls). However, rather than use NPls, the 150 shoppers are divided into 3 groups of about equal size; those with the fewest, second most, and most items wrapped in plastic (NPls1, NPls2, NPls3). The proposed model is E(NErr | NScn, NPls2, NPls3) = B1 NScn + B2 (NScn)(NPls2) + B3 (NScn)(NPls3). "

"One Value per Category"
"Consumption (Con) is a function of after-tax income (Inc) and the type of family (Fam). Con and Inc are measured in thousands of dollars. Fam is 1 if the head of the family is single, 2 if the family is intact (husband and wife present) with 1 wage earner, and 3 if the family is intact with two wage earners. However, rather than use Fam, three binary variables are created, one for each category (Fam1, Fam2, Fam3). The proposed model is E(Con | Inc, NFam2, Fam3) = B0 + B1 Inc + B2 Fam2 + B3 (Fam2)(Inc) + B4 Fam3 + B5 (Fam3)(Inc). "

"Statistics Course Grades"
"Final course grade for 79 students in two sections of a beginning business statistics course at Oakland University. The same instructor taught both sections. Grade = f(Exam1, QPass) and a third variable is ProjGr. Grade is the final grade in the course recorded in tenths from 0.0 to 4.0. Exam1 is the grade on the first exam covering material up to and including the normal distribution. QPass (binary variable) indicates whether the student passed an unannounced quiz on EDA (coded 1 if grade was 2.0 or better, 0 if not). ProjGr is the student's grade on an EDA project."

"Fat Content of Cookies"
"The number of calories per gram or 40 cookies. Proposed model is CalGm = f(FatGm, Nabisco) and a third variable is ServSize. CalGm is the number of calories per gram. FatGm is the number of grams of fat per gram of cookie. Nabisco (binary variable) is coded 1 if the cookie is made by Nabisco, 0 if not. ServSize is the number of grams in a serving. Data was collected by statistics students Frank George, Karen Orso, and Lincy Zachariah as part of an independent project.  Data are for educational purposes only and should not be viewed as a guide to products."

"Alcoholism Screening"
"Alcoholism screening score for 50 subjects. Proposed model is AlcSc = f(YrsEm, ParAlc) and a third variable is Arr. AlcSc is the subject's score on a 24-question alcoholism screening test. YrsEm is the number of years the subject has been employed. ParAlc (binary variable) is coded 1 if either of the subject's parents were alcoholic. Arr is the number of times the subject has been arrested. Data are from an independent research project by master's degree candidates Judy Grucz and Noreen Johnson.

"Statistics Course Grades"
"Final course grade for 79 students in two sections of a beginning business statistics course at Oakland University. The same instructor taught both sections. Grade = f(Exam1, PopQ1Pass) and a third variable is Proj1Grd. Grade is the final grade in the course recorded in tenths from 0.0 to 4.0. Exam1 is the grade on the first exam covering material up to and including the normal distribution. PopQ1Pass (binary variable) indicates whether the student passed an unannounced quiz on EDA (coded 1 if grade was 2.0 or better, 0 if not). Proj1Grd is the student's grade on an EDA project."
