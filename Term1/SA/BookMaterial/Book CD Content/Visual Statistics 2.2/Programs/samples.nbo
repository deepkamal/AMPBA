"Smoke Stack Emissions"
"A coal-fired electric power plant emits sulfur dioxide (SO2). The power plant continuously measures these emissions and daily records its average emissions. To be in compliance with the EPA, a plant's daily emissions can exceed 140 parts per billion (ppb) only one day per year and must average below 30 ppb for the entire year. Suppose that 182 samples (half a year) are taken. Is the power plant in compliance? Investigate the population by examining the sample. Repeat the experiment as designed or modify it as desired."
