"Battery Voltage"
"The voltage of a new battery is supposed to be 1.5 volts. The population standard deviation is believed to be 0.1 volts. A random sample of 36 new batteries is taken and the voltage of each battery is measured. What is the power of a two-tailed test at the .01 level of significance if the true mean is 1.45 volts? Over what range is the power curve below 1? What happens to the power curve if the sample size is increased to 100?"

"Beer Mug Diameter"
"The diameter of an inexpensive ceramic beer mug is supposed to be 3.5 inches. The population standard deviation is believed to be 0.2 inches. Suppose that 16 randomly-chosen beer mugs are measured. At the .10 level of significance, what is the power of a right-tailed test if the true mean is 3.6 inches? What is the effective range of the power curve? What happens to the power curve if the standard deviation is doubled?"
