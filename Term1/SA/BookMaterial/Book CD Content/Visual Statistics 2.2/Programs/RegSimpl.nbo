"Wage vs. Job Complexity"
"Firms usually pay more to employees with complex jobs. Suppose a firm evaluates the complexity of its jobs. It decides that each rating point should be rewarded by $1 thousand, with jobs with a rating of zero having a wage of $10 thousand. In this situation, the conditional mean of the average employee's wage would be W = $10+ $1 C, where W is the wage (in thousands), and C is the job's complexity. Human resource specialists call this a pay plan model. Study this model for complexities between 20 and 45. Because other factors affect an employee's wage, R-Squared is about 0.75. Sample size is initially set at 40 employees."

"Return on Investment vs. Risk"
"Investors expect a higher return on investments with more risk. Suppose that for every 1% increase in risk, investors earn a 1% higher return. Investment with no risk should earn 8%. In this situation, the conditional mean on the rate of return would be P = 8 + 1 K, where P is percent return and K is the investment's risk. Financial analysts call this a Capital Asset Pricing Model. Study this model for investments with risks between 0 and 10 (assume the average for the market is 5). Because other factors affect the rate of return (e.g. industry performance), R-Squared is about 0.30. Sample size is initially set at 25."
"The conditional mean for the rate of return on an investment is P = 8 + 1 K, where P is percentage rate of return and K is the risk associated with the investment. R-Squared is about 0.30 when we study 25 firms with risk ranging between 0 and 10."

"Test Scores vs. Job Performance"
"Job candidates who do well on selection tests generally perform better on the job. Based upon experience, a firm knows that each point a candidate earns on a selection test translates to 2 points in job performance. A candidate who scores 0 would have a job performance rating of -50. The conditional mean for job performance would be J = -50 + 2 S, where J is the job performance score 1 year after being employed and S is the candidate's test score. Study this model for test scores between 80 and 100. Because other factors affect job performance (e.g. motivation), R-Squared is only about 0.10. The sample size is initially 50 new employees."

"State Income Tax vs. Income"
"As a family's income increases, it generally pays more state income tax. Assume that the average family pays no taxes on the first $5 thousand and 3 percent of every additional dollar earned. In this situation, the conditional mean for the family's tax would be T = -$0.15 + .03 W, where T is tax and W is income (both in thousands). Study this model for families whose income is between $20 thousand and $50 thousand. Because other factors affect a family's tax bill (e.g. number of deductions), R-Squared is about 0.08. Sample size is initially set at 75 families."

"Quantity Purchased vs. Price"
"In general, as a product's price rises, people buy less. Consider a farmer selling eggs by the roadside. Customers buy as many as they wish (i.e. 1,2,3,...). The farmer thinks that the average consumer will buy a dozen eggs at 10¢ per egg, and an extra egg for every 2.5¢ he lowers the price of an egg. In this situation, the conditional mean for the eggs a customer will buy is Q = 37 - 2.5 P, where Q is the quantity and P is the price. Economists call this a demand model. Study the model for prices between 3¢ and 8¢. Other factors affect the quantity people buy (e.g. family size), so R-Squared is about 0.40. Sample size is initially 5 customers sampled on different days."

"Consumption vs. Income"
"As a family's income rises, it generally consumes more. Suppose the average family spends 80¢ of every additional after-tax dollar, spending $100 per week if they have no income (taken from savings). In this situation, the conditional mean for consumption would be C = $100 + .80 W, where C is consumption and W is after-tax income. Economists call this a consumption model. Study the model for families whose weekly income is between $300 and $700. Other factors affect consumption besides income (e.g. family size), so R-Squared is about 0.40. Sample size is initially 20 families."

"Unemployment vs. Growth"
"In general, as the economy grows, unemployment decreases. Assume that if the economy grows by 2.5% then unemployment decreases by 1%. In this situation the conditional mean for the change in the unemployment rate would be U = -0.4 E (the intercept is zero), where U is the change in the unemployment rate and E is economic growth. Economists call this relation Okun's Law. Study this model for economic growth between -1% and 2.5%. Because few other factors affect the change in the unemployment rate, R-Squared is about 0.80. Sample size is initially set at 10 periods."

"Inflation vs. Money Growth"
"Many experts believe that inflation is primarily caused by excessive growth in the money supply. Assume that inflation increases by 1% for every percent growth in the money supply, and that inflation is -2% (i.e. there is deflation) if the money supply does not change. In this situation the conditional mean for inflation is I = -2 + 1 M, where I is inflation and M is growth in the money supply. Study this model for money growth between 0% and 10%. Because other factors affect inflation R-Squared is about 0.55. Sample size is initially set at 15 periods."

"Automatic Bottle Filling"
"The main factor affecting the amount of soda poured into a 2 liter (2000 ml) bottle is the time the filling machine's valve is open. Although a machine's specifications are that 1000 ml should be put into a bottle in 400 milliseconds, there is some error. In this situation, the conditional mean for the amount of soda in a bottle would be Q = 2.25 T (the intercept is zero), where Q is the quantity of soda in ml and T is the time the valve is open in milliseconds. Study this bottle filling model for times between 790 and 810 milliseconds. Because very few other factors affect the amount of soda in the bottle, R-Squared is about 0.99. Sample size is initially set at 100 bottles."

"Number of Bar Scanning Errors"
"Supermarket cashiers are sometimes unable to scan bar codes. Suppose a supermarket finds that 5% of codes are unreadable with its equipment. In this situation, the conditional mean of the number of unread bar codes is U = .05 N (the intercept is zero) where U is the number of unreadable codes in a shopping cart containing N items. Study this model for shopping carts containing between 60 and 200 items. Because the mix of groceries purchased by most customers is fairly similar, R-Squared is about 0.80. Sample size is initially set at 60 shopping carts."

"Wage vs. Job Complexity"
"Firms usually pay more to employees with complex jobs. Suppose a firm evaluates the complexity of its jobs. It decides that each rating point should be rewarded by $1 thousand, with jobs with a rating of zero having a wage of $10 thousand. In this situation, the conditional mean of the average employee's wage would be W = $10+ $1 C, where W is the wage (in thousands), and C is the job's complexity. Human resource specialists call this a pay plan model. Study this model for complexities between 20 and 45. Because other factors affect an employee's wage, R-Squared is about 0.75. Sample size is initially set at 40 employees."
"The conditional mean for an employee's wage is W = $10 + $1 C, where W is the employee's wage (in thousands), and C is the job's complexity rating. R-Squared is about 0.75 when we study 40 employees with job complexities between 20 and 45."
