"True-False Exam Scores"
"In a large biology class of 74 students, the instructor gives a 50-question true-false exam. The instructor wonders if the students were merely guessing (p=.5 on each question). Does the sample support the belief that exam scores follow a binomial distribution with n=50 and p=.50? If the parameters are estimated from the sample, what is the result? Would a normal distribution give an acceptable fit to this data?"
