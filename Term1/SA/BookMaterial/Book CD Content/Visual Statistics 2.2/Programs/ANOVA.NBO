"Fertilizer and Tomato Growth"
"A field of hybrid tomatoes is subdivided into several plots and a different fertilizer is applied to each plot. Plots are similar but there may be differences due to various unknown factors (e.g. soil, drainage, planting depth) in addition to the fertilizer's effects. After ten weeks, tomatoes are sampled at random from each plot. Is the mean size of a tomato the same for all these plots? Are the variances the same?"

"Fertilizer and Wheat Yields"

Plots are similar but unknown factors may exist (e.g. soil, drainage, planting depth) in addition to the fertilizer's effects.

"Automobile Crash Damage"
"Automobile crash testing is expensive, but it is the only way that a manufacturer can find out how much damage will result from a collision. A car maker tests several bumper styles to compare the dollar damage from a 10 MPH  rear-end collision, holding other factors constant. Does the mean cost to repair crash damage vary among the bumper styles? Are the variances equal?"

"Fertilizer and Tomato Growth"
"A field of hybrid tomatoes is subdivided into several plots and a different fertilizer is applied to each plot. Plots are similar but there may be differences due to various unknown factors (e.g. soil, drainage, planting depth) in addition to the fertilizer's effects. After ten weeks, tomatoes are sampled at random from each plot. Is the mean size of a tomato the same for all these plots? Are the variances the same?"
