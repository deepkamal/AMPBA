"Untransformed Variables"
"The law of demand states that quantity demanded (Q) and price (P) are inversely related, all other things being equal. Assume that an auctioneer yells out 20 prices and counts the quantity of widgets that people are willing and able to buy. A simple straight line demand equation, explained in most textbooks, is Q = a + b P + u, where b < 0. In this model, a 1 unit change in P results in a b unit change in Q. Although economists put P on the left side of the equation, Q is the dependent variable and will be put on the left side where it belongs. A potential interaction variable is the number of people in the family (FamSiz)."

"Standardized Variables"
"Standardized variables have a sample mean of 0 and a sample standard deviation of 1 (see Help for details). Psychologists and human resource specialists often use regression models with standardized variables. Consider the model Std(Wage) = a + b Std(Cmplx)+ u, where b > 0, i.e., a job's wage (Wage) is a function of its complexity (Cmplx). The coefficients are called beta weights. In this model, a 1 standard deviation change in a job's complexity results in a b standard deviation change in its wage. A potential interaction variable is the job's required educational level (Ed). Ed is 1 if high school, 2 if some college, 3 if college degree, and 4 if graduate degree."

"Exponential Growth Model"
"Many macroeconomic variables grow at an exponential rate since the overall economy grows exponentially. A proposed time series trend model is Ln(GDP) = a + b Period + u, where Ln is the natural log transformation, GDP is Gross Domestic Product, and Period is the time period (from 1 to 24). In this model, a 1 period change results in a 100b% change in GDP. A potential interaction variable is the binary variable for a recession (Rec). NOTE: If no war years are in the data generated and you try to estimate an interaction model, press Yes on the error message and use a different version number."

"Declining Returns Model"
"Many microeconomic variables have a declining growth rate due to diminishing returns. For example, Q = a + b Ln(Empl) + u, where Ln is the natural log transformation, Q is a firm's output, and Empl is the level of employment. In this model, a 1% change in Empl results in Q changing by b/100 units. A potential interaction variable is the amount of capital (Cap) in millions of dollars."

"Elasticity Models"
"Economists often model demand curves as constant elasticity models. For example, Ln(Beer) = a + b Ln(P) + u, where Ln is the natural log transformation, Beer is the number of cans of beer demanded per adult per week, and P is the price. In this model, a 1% change in P results in a b% change in quantity. A potential interaction variable is the person's race (Race). It is coded 1 for Black, 2 for Oriental, 3 Caucasian."

"Quadratic Model"
"The appeal of a quadratic model is its flexibility. It can be used to identify declining, accelerating, or constant growth by examining the coefficient of the squared term. Consider the model Profit = a + b Rev + c Rev² + u , i.e., quarterly profits (millions of dollars) are a function of the firm's revenues (millions of dollars). If estimated c is statistically greater than zero, then Rev causes Profit to increase at an increasing rate; if statistically less than zero, then Rev causes Profit to increase at a decreasing rate; and if equal to zero, then Rev causes Profit to increase by a constant rate. A potential interaction variable is the product's price P."

"Power of X Transformation"
"A power of X transformation is a flexible transformation that can model a growth model (power greater than 1) or a declining growth model (power less than 1). However, the variable must be transformed BEFORE the model can be estimated with ordinary least squares. For example, consider the model Output = a + b Capital^0.2 + u, where b > 0, i.e., output per plant (thousands of units) is a declining function of capital per plant (units). In this case Capital is raised to the 0.2 power. A potential interaction variable is the firm's number of plants."

However, the variable must be transformed BEFORE the model can be estimated with ordinary least squares. For example, consider the model Revenue² = a + b Adver + u, where b > 0, i.e., revenue (millions of dollars) per month is a declining function of advertising expenditures (millions of dollars).

"Reciprocal of X Model"
"One possible reciprocal model is Q = b/P + u, where P is price and Q is quantity demanded. This very special demand function has an elasticity of -1 regardless of the value of b. That is, a 1% change in P results in a -1% change in Q. In this model, b measures the distance the estimated model is from the origin (the estimated function goes through (1,b) and (b,1)). A potential interaction variable is the price of a substitute good, that is a good that could be used instead of the original good (PSub). The substitute's price varies between $5, $6, and $7."
