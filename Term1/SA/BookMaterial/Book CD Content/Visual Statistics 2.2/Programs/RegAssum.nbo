"Wage vs. Job Complexity"
"Firms usually pay more to employees with complex jobs. A firm evaluates the complexity of its jobs. It decides that each rating point should be rewarded by $1 thousand, with jobs with a rating of zero having a wage of $10 thousand. In this situation, the conditional mean of the average employee's wage would be W = $10 + $1 C, where W is the wage (in thousands), and C is the job's complexity. Human resource specialists call this a pay plan model. Study this model for complexities between 20 and 45. Because other factors affect an employee's wage, R-Squared is about 0.75. Sample size is initially set at 40 employees."

"State Income Tax vs. Income"
"As a family's income increases, it generally pays more state income tax. Assume that the average family pays no taxes on the first $5 thousand and 3 percent of every additional dollar earned. In this situation, the conditional mean for the family's tax would be T = -$0.15 + .03 W, where T is tax and W is income (both in thousands). Study this model for families whose income is between $20 thousand and $50 thousand. Because other factors affect a family's tax bill (e.g. number of deductions), R-Squared is about 0.08. Sample size is initially set at 75 families."

"Job Performance vs. Test Scores "
"Job candidates who do well on selection tests generally perform better on the job. Based upon experience, a firm knows that each point a candidate earns on a selection test translates to 2 points in job performance. A candidate who scores 0 would have a job performance rating of -50. The conditional mean for job performance would be J = -50 + 2 S, where J is the job performance score 1 year after being employed and S is the candidate's test score. Study this model for test scores between 80 and 100. Because other factors affect job performance (e.g. motivation), R-Squared is only about 0.10. The sample size is initially 50 new employees."

"Severe Positive Autocorrelation"
"Aggregate Consumption vs. Aggregate Disposable Income: Just as for individuals, at the national level (aggregate) consumption rises with disposable income. However, over time this relation suffers from severe autocorrelation (rho = 0.9). The conditional mean is C = $50 + 0.87 DI, where C is personal consumption and DI is disposable (after-tax) income. This time series relation is almost exact, so R-Squared is about 0.95. Sample size is initially 40 years."

"Moderate Positive Autocorrelation"
"Household Consumption vs. Household Income: As a household's income rises, it generally consumes more. Suppose the average household spends 80¢ of every additional after-tax dollar, and spends $100 per week if it has no income (taken from savings). In this situation, the conditional mean for consumption C would be C = $100 + .80 I, where I is after-tax income. This model suffers from moderate autocorrelation (rho = 0.5). Study the model for households whose weekly income is between $300 and $700. Because other factors affect consumption besides income, R-Squared is about 0.45. Sample size is initially 50 households."

"Negative Autocorrelation"
"Over-adjustment Model: If a machine operator adjusts a machine for every deviation from the expected setting an over-adjustment is made. That is, every piece that is above the setting is followed by another piece that is below the expected setting, and vice versa. A possible model is Q = 2000.0 + 0 S, where Q is the amount of soft drink in milliliters in a 2 liter bottle and S is the sequence number of the bottle on the assembly line. Study this process for 60 bottles. The autocorrelation coefficient is negative (rho = -0.8). Because the slope is zero, R-Squared is about 0.0."

"Heteroskedasticity Related to X"
"Inflation vs. Money Growth: Many experts believe that inflation is primarily caused by excessive growth in the money supply. Assume that inflation increases by 1% for every percent growth in the money supply, and that inflation is -2% (i.e. there is deflation) if the money supply does not change. In this situation the conditional mean for inflation is I = -2 + 1 M, where I is inflation and M is growth in the money supply. Study this model for money growth in 40 countries whose money growth is between 1% and 100%. Because other factors affect inflation R-Squared is about 0.7. The heteroskedastic error term is positively related to money growth M."

"Heteroskedasticity Related to E(Y)"

A golf professional might carry a 1 through 9 iron, pitching wedge (10 iron), sand wedge (11 iron), and flop wedge (12 iron).  A possible conditional mean for club accuracy could be D = 40 - 3 C, where D is the distance from the target in feet and C is the club number. Because other factors affect the accuracy of a shot (swing plane, tempo, etc.), R-Squared is about 0.65. The heteroskedastic error term is directly related to the expected distance from the target.

"Uniformly Distributed Error Term"
"4-Digit Lottery and Age: A common daily lottery game is to choose a random number between 1 and 1000. Although no factor should affect the number selected each day, there could be a bias in the number a certain type of person selects. For example, if older people picked slightly larger numbers the conditional mean could be N = 481 + 1 A, where N is the number selected and A is the person's age. Study this model for 100 individuals between the ages of 20 and 80. In this case, the distribution of the error term is uniform, because each number can be selected with equal likelihood. Since the relationship is very weak the R-Squared is about 0.0."

"Peaked Error Term"
"Distance Golf Ball Travels and Club Selection: When a golf ball is hit with a lower number golf club it will travel farther. Generally, the distance traveled by the golf ball is almost exactly the same if it is struck the same. A possible conditional mean is that the distance a ball travels D (in yards) is 240 - 10 C, where C is the club number from 2 to 10 (10 being a pitching wedge). Because the distance is generally so precise, the distribution of the error term is more peaked than a normal distribution and the R-Squared is about 0.96. Study this situation for 100 shots."

"Triangularly Distributed Error Term"
"Page Selected vs. GPA: Students are paired up in a statistics class and each is asked to open his/her statistics book to a random page and to write it down. The students then add their page numbers together and take the average of their current class grade. A behaviorist has suggested that students doing well in a course open the text deeper than students who are struggling. If so, a possible conditional mean for the sum S is S = 450 + 25 G, where G is the average of the two student grades. There are 30 pairs of students in the class."

"Omitted Variable"
"Rate of Return vs. Risk: In finance, the expected rate of return increases with the risk that the investor takes. A student suggests that the expected rate of return R on corporate bonds is conditional on the firm's risk rating K, where K is between 1 (blue chip) and 10 (highly speculative), i.e., R = f(K). This model ignores the risk due to the time until maturity, i.e., more time, greater risk. Assume the true conditional mean R = 5 + 1 K + 0.2 Y, where Y is years until maturity. Study the student's model for 50 bonds, with K between 1 and 10, and Y between 5 and 20. Because more risky firms borrow for shorter time periods, the correlation between Y and K is -0.3."

"Incorrect Functional Form"
"Diminishing Returns Model: As a firm adds more labor to a fixed plant size (with fixed capital equipment) the amount of output increases at a decreasing rate. In economics this is called the Law of Diminishing Returns. The correct conditional mean for output Q (in thousands of units) is Q = 129 + 62 Ln(E), where E is the number of employees. This model suggests that a 1% growth in employees will improve output by 620 units (62/100*1000). Unfortunately, the employee modeling output used the model Q = a + b E, i.e., the wrong functional form. Study this model for 20 quarters."

"Stochastic Independent Variable"
"Percent of Misread Bar Codes: Supermarket cashiers are sometimes unable to scan bar codes. Suppose a supermarket finds that 5% of codes are unreadable with its equipment. In this situation, the conditional mean of the number of unread bar codes is U = 0.05 N (the intercept is zero) where U is the number of unreadable codes in a shopping cart containing N items. Study this model for shopping carts containing between 50 and 200 items. Because the mix of groceries purchased by most customers is fairly similar, R-Squared is about 0.60. Sample size is initially set at 60 shopping carts."

"Error Term and X Variable Correlated"
"Supply and Demand: A demand curve says that quantity demanded Q is inversely related to price P or Q = a - b P. But if this function is estimated without a supply function, there is a violation of the assumption of independence between the independent variable (P in this case) and the disturbance term. Study this demand curve for 40 prices between $5 and $10 when the correlation between price and the disturbance term is only 0.1. The true conditional mean of the demand curve is Q = 20 - 0.5 P, where Q is in thousands, and it has an R-Squared of about 0.25 since the supply curve was ignored. "

"Wage vs. Job Complexity"
"Firms usually pay more to employees with complex jobs. A firm evaluates the complexity of its jobs. It decides that each rating point should be rewarded by $1 thousand, with jobs with a rating of zero having a wage of $10 thousand. In this situation, the conditional mean of the average employee's wage would be W = $10 + $1 C, where W is the wage (in thousands), and C is the job's complexity. Human resource specialists call this a pay plan model. Study this model for complexities between 20 and 45. Because other factors affect an employee's wage, R-Squared is about 0.75. Sample size is initially set at 40 employees."
