"Filling Jars"
"A spaghetti sauce manufacturer wants 794 grams (28 ounces) in its spaghetti sauce jars. The amount of spaghetti sauce that is put in each jar is normally distributed with a standard deviation of 3 grams. The firm will stop the assembly line and adjust the filling machine if jars are either under-filled (angering customers) or overfilled (costing the firm money).  Based on a sample of 15 jars, should the assembly line be shut down?"

"SAT2 Test Results"
"Six students in a high school take the SAT2 test in Physics. The test is designed so that test scores are approximately normally distributed with a standard deviation of 100. The school's counselor believes that the six students will outperform the average student taking the exam. The national average is 630. Based on the sample results, have the six students statistically outperformed the average student?"

"Starting Salary of College Graduates"
"A college placement officer at a small liberal arts college fears that its graduates have lower starting salaries than liberal arts graduate from other colleges and universities. Based upon government statistics, the placement office knows that the average starting salary of liberal arts majors nationally is $41 thousand with a standard deviation of $3 thousand. Thirty recent graduates returned a survey that asked their starting salaries. Why might starting salaries not be normally distributed? Can the z-test for Mu be used in this case? Are the placement officer's fears justified?"

"Lottery Number"
"Five friends play a three digit lottery game run by their state. Each selects a three-digit number between 001 and 999. One of the players bets another player that the average of the 5 numbers selected is statistically equal to 500. Since selecting a lottery number has a uniform distribution, the standard deviation is 288. Can the z-test for Mu be used in this case? Is the sample mean statistically equal to 500?"

"In this chapter, you will learn about one-sample hypothesis testing. You will examine questions such as:"
#FALSE#

"How much power is lost in the Student's t test for a mean if the population sampled is non-normal?"
#TRUE#
0
"In tests of a variance, if the population is skewed instead of normal, is the distribution of the test statistic still approximately chi-square?"
#TRUE#
0
"Can increasing the sample size compensate for loss of power due to non-normality in the sampled population, when testing hypothesis about a variance?"
