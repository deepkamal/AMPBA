"Piston Aircraft"
"Topics illustrated: well-behaved cross-sectional data. 40 aircraft, 5 variables. Dependent variable is the plane's cruise speed. Independent variables are its year of manufacture, number of propeller blades, whether engine is turbocharged, and total horsepower. Data are taken from used airplane reports in Flying Magazine (various issues from 1997 to 1999). Data are for educational use only and should not be viewed as a guide to aircraft performance. Data were entered by statistics student Douglas H. Hogg, Jr."

"Topics illustrated: binary variables, squared predictors, tests of non-linearity, definitional variance inflation. 61 observations, 7 variables. Dependent variable is cockpit noise level in decibels. Independent variables are the flight phase (cruise, descent), airspeed, altitude, and squared airspeed and altitude. Sound level was measured by a pilot in seven different aircraft at the first officer's left ear position using a hand-held meter. Data courtesy of Capt. Robert E. Hartl, a member of the Air Line Pilots Association."

Independent variables are the monitor's brightness, contrast ratio, and measures of its horizontal and vertical contrast and color.  Data are from PC Magazine, Vol. 18, No. 8, April 20, 1999, pp. 134-139. Data are intended for educational use only, not as a guide to selecting an LCD monitor. One non-LCD monitor is included for comparison. Statistics student Douglas H. Hogg, Jr. entered the data."

"Money Supply"
"Problems illustrated: severe multicollinearity, spurious non-causal correlation in trended data. 26 years, 5 variables. Dependent variable is the M1 money supply. Independent variables are total exports, imports, personal consumption, and personal income. Data are from the Economic Report of the President, 1986. Like the Longley data, this data set is not proposed as a reasonable model, but rather as an illustration of extreme variance inflation and logical problems with regression on heavily-trended time series data."

"Topics illustrated: ill-conditioned data, multicollinearity, spurious (non-causal) correlation. 16 years, 7 variables. Dependent variable is total derived employment. Independent variables are GNP price deflator, GNP, total unemployment, size of armed forces, population age 14 and over, and year. James W. Longley's 1967 data are from A. Beaton, D. Rubin, and J. Barone, 'The Acceptability of Regression Solutions: Another Look at Computational Accuracy', Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 71, No. 353, March, 1976, p. 159. This data illustrates extreme data problems, but is not proposed as a reasonable model."

"Topics illustrated: autocorrelation, collinearity. 24 years, 4 variables. Dependent variable is total personal savings. Independent variables are total personal income, mean percent yield on 3-month treasury bills, and the percent change in the consumer price index. Data for 1970-1993 are from the 1994 Economic Report of the President. Files were prepared by Cindy Hollifield and Douglas Dotterweich of East Tennessee State University and Penny Dierickx of Oakland University. This simple macroeconomic model uses variables that are commonly studied by economists."

"252 male subjects, 18 variables. Variables include adiposity index, two different measurements of percent body fat, age, weight, height, fat free weight, and circumference of neck, chest, hip, thigh, knee, ankle, biceps, forearm, and wrist. Percent body fat estimates are truncated to zero when negative. Data are from Roger W. Johnson, 'Fitting Percentage of Body Fat to Simple Body Measurements', Journal of Statistics Education, 1996. Original data were supplied by Dr. A. Garth Fisher, Human Performance Research Center, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah."
