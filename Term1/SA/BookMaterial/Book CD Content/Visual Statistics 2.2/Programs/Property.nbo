"ACT Test Scores"
"Many would-be college students are required to take the ACT test. ACT test scores are approximately normally distributed. A high school counselor collects 5 test scores from seniors who took the exam. He calculates the sample mean. If the experiment is repeated many times, are the sample means normally distributed (i.e. is the Central Limit Theorem applicable)? Is the sample mean a consistent estimator for Mu? Repeat the experiment as designed or modify it as desired."

"Golf Professional"
"A touring golf pro practices by hitting 15 golf balls with a 5 iron. His caddie measures how far each ball is right (positive) or left (negative) of his target. The distribution is symmetric but more peaked than a normal distribution. Is the sample mean an unbiased estimator of the true population mean Mu? If the pro repeated the experiment many times, would the sample means be normally distributed (i.e. is the Central Limit Theorem applicable)? Is the sample mean a consistent estimator for Mu? Repeat the experiment as designed or modify it as desired."

"The Sum of Two Random Numbers"
"10 students are asked to select two random numbers using the RND button on a calculator and add them together. We know that the sum will have a triangular distribution with a minimum of 0, maximum of 2 and a mode of 1. Is the sample mean of these 10 sums an unbiased estimator for Mu? If this experiment were repeated many times, would the sample mean be normally distributed (i.e. is the Central Limit Theorem applicable)? Is the sample mean a consistent estimator for Mu? Repeat the experiment as designed or modify it as desired."

"Smoke Stack Emissions"
"A coal-fired electric power plant emits sulfur dioxide (SO2). Such emissions have a very positively skewed distribution. The power plant continuously measures these emissions and records its average emissions daily. To be in compliance with the EPA's yearly rule, a plant must average less than 30 ppb for the entire year. Suppose that 30 daily samples are averaged. Is this sample mean an unbiased and/or consistent estimator of Mu? If the experiment were repeated many times, would the sample means be normally distributed (i.e. is the Central Limit Theorem applicable)? Repeat the experiment as designed or modify it as desired."

"SAT Verbal Test Scores"
"Many would-be college students are required to take the SAT test. SAT Verbal test scores are approximately normally distributed. A high school counselor collects 100 test scores from seniors who took the exam in October. He calculates the sample median (50th percentile) of the 100 scores. Is this an unbiased estimator of the population mean Mu? If this experiment were repeated many times, would the distribution of the sample median be relatively efficient compared to the sample mean? Repeat the experiment as designed or modify it as desired."

"Iron Byron"
"The U.S. Golf Association has developed the Iron Byron to hit a golf ball uniformly with any golf club. It was designed to test both balls and clubs for conformance to USGA rules. In testing a particular ball with a 5 iron 50 balls are hit. The distance the ball travels is normally distributed. The sample variance is calculated. Is the sample variance an unbiased and/or consistent estimator for Sigma Squared? If this experiment were repeated many times, would the sample variance have a chi-square distribution? Repeat the experiment as designed or modify it as desired."

"Sum of Two Random Numbers"
"50 students are asked to select two random numbers between 90 and 110 using a calculator (20*RND +90) and add them together. We know that the sum will have a triangular distribution with a minimum of 90, maximum of 110 and a mode of 100. If we take the sample variance of these 50 sums, is it an unbiased estimator for Sigma Squared? If this experiment were repeated many times, would the estimator have a chi-square distribution? Is the sample variance a consistent estimator for sigma square? Repeat the experiment as designed or modify it as desired."
