Rapid Linear Growth
Time series increases by a large but constant amount every period.  This type of trend suggests steady underlying conditions which favor brisk but not accelerating growth.  This pattern would typify demand during periods of strong, steady growth.

Examples
Sales of new cars during an economic upswing. Orders for plumbing supplies during a period when new construction is expanding.  Job openings for programmers skilled in Windows applications development.
END
Slow Linear Growth
Time series increases by a modest constant amount every period.  This type of trend suggests steady underlying conditions which favor modest growth.  This pattern would typify mature markets for necessities when population is growing slowly, or for luxuries when income is growing slowly.

Examples
Sales of copier paper.  Job openings for funeral directors.  Bushels of wheat harvested annually.
END
No Growth
Time series has no trend.  This suggests steady underlying conditions.  This pattern would typify mature product markets for replacement of necessities which wear out under conditions of stable population or zero economic growth. 

Examples
Orders for light bulbs in an office building.  Attendance at basketball games at a high school.  Number of U.S. congressional representatives re-elected.  Job openings for university presidents.
END
Slow Linear Decline
Time series decreases by a modest constant amount every period.  This type of trend suggests steady underlying conditions which favor continuous decline.  This pattern would typify markets for items which are slowly going out of style. 

Examples
Sales of ribbons for old-style line printers.  Sales of old-style 5-1/4 inch diskettes.  Job openings for residential meter readers or middle-level executives.  Federal support for the arts.
END
Rapid Linear Decline
Time series falls by a large but constant amount every period.  This type of trend suggests steady underlying conditions which favor sharp but not accelerating decline.  This pattern would typify demand for products which are out of fashion.

Examples
Registrations of autos without daytime running lights.  Job openings for DOS experts.
END
Trough Then Peak
Time series falls, hits a trough, rises, hits a peak, and begins to fall again.  This type of trend suggests cyclical forces which ultimately favor growth.  Such a pattern exists in durable goods industries over the long run or other industries during cycles of recession and expansion while population and income grow.

Examples
Sales of refrigerators or automobiles.  Housing starts when interest rates fluctuate but trend downward.  
END
Growth Level Off
Time series grows at an increasing rate, then slows down.  This type of trend is typical of new business products which eventually reach market saturation, or when other limits are reached.

Examples
Sales of a new software product.  Total number of telephone customers who use call-waiting.  Acres of irrigated California farmland.
END
Trough Then Growth
Time series declines at first, reaches a valley, then grows at an increasing rate.  This type of trend is typical of sales of new products or services which enjoy initial success, then encounter problems or are shown to have flaws, but eventually find a strategy for success and recover strongly.

Examples
Housing starts during a recession followed by a boom.  U.S. imports as the dollar weakens and then strengthens steadily.
END
Accelerating Growth
Time series grows at an ever-increasing rate with no end in sight.  Such trends may exist for sales of "fad" products or innovative goods and services.  Accelerating growth may only be possible over finite intervals for many products, although long-run prices of non-renewable resources may rise without apparent bounds.

Examples
Price of first-growth lumber over the last 50 years.  Sales of cellular phones.  World population for the last 1000 years.
END
Slowing Growth
Time series grows at an ever-slowing rate.  Slowing growth may occur when market penetration has been achieved or when an industry approaches maturity and products approach the end of their life cycle.

Examples
Sales of books about Excel.  Number of Americans who vacation in Europe every summer.  Number of new jobs in the service sector.
END
Peak Then Trough
Time series rises, hits a peak, falls, hits a trough, and begins to rise again but not back to the former level.  This type of trend suggests cyclical forces which ultimately favor decline.  Such a pattern exists in sales or employment in durable goods industries whose products are losing consumer interest or cyclical services with weakening appeal.

Examples
Employment of hourly assembly workers in a developed nation's automobile industry.  Worldwide sales of nuclear-reactor cores.  Sales of full-size automobiles in the last 50 years.
END
Decline Level Off 
Time series falls at an increasing rate, then begins to flatten out.  This type of trend suggests a one-time shift in consumer preferences to a lower level of demand.  For a firm, this could be "downsizing" to a stable level.

Examples
Rentals of a new video release (very high at first, but drop off rapidly toward a core level of repeat viewers).  Employment in an industry that is "getting lean" (the new required level of management after downsizing is the asymptote).  
END
Peak Then Decline
Time series hits a peak, then declines at an increasing rate.  This trend could apply to a product that was initially popular, but proved dangerous or was supplanted by a strong competitor.

Examples
Silicone breast implants.  Cabbage patch doll sales.  Sales of DOS.  Ratings of a new television series that didn't keep its audience interest after the first few episodes. 
END
Accelerating Decline 
Time series falls at an increasing rate.  This type of trend suggests a total loss of market, as might occur if a product is proven dangerous or is supplanted by a much better competitor.  A sales trend must stop at zero is reached, although a profit trend could go negative (until bankruptcy occurs).

Examples
Sales of a good DOS software package that wasn't redesigned for Windows.  Population of an endangered species.
END
Slowing Decline 
Time series falls at a decreasing rate.  This type of trend suggests that a new, stable level may be reached.  In sales, a core market may remain after a volatile market is lost to competitors.  In technology, limits may be approached.

Examples
Price per megabyte of computer memory chips.  Tons of ozone-destroying chemicals released over the last decade.
