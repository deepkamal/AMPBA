INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING THE SINGLE USER VERSION OF 
VISUAL STATISTICS

INSTALLING VS
The install program is Setup.exe in the Setup folder 
located in the Visual Statistics 2.2 folder. It can be 
executed in three ways. First, by double-clicking the file 
in your Windows Explorer (or from My Computer). Second, by 
typing d:\visual statistics 2.2\setup\setup.exe (where d: 
represents the drive letter for your CD reader) in Run in 
Start. Third, by using the Add/Remove Programs dialog box 
in the Windows Control Panel.

You will be asked to select the setup type. Select either 
COMPACT or COMPLETE. BOTH VERSIONS REQUIRE YOUR VISUAL 
STATISTICS CD TO BE IN YOUR COMPUTER FOR VS TO OPERATE.

COMPACT -- Installs only the front end of Visual Statistics 
on your computer and the necessary system files. It takes 
up to 10MB of room on your hard drive or as much as 60MB 
LESS room than the COMPLETE installation.

COMPLETE -- Installs the entire Visual Statistics system on 
your computer. It takes up to 70MB of room on your hard 
drive or as much as 60MB MORE room than the COMPACT 
installation. However, on computers with older CD drives it 
runs faster.

Read the License Agreement during the install. It can also 
be read by selecting the Visual Statistics 2.2 folder in 
the Programs folder in Start (lower left corner on your 
Task Bar). Visual Statistics can be started from this 
folder or by double clicking the VS icon that will be 
installed on your desktop. Once the system files have been 
installed on your computer, Visual Statistics can also be 
run directly from the CD by opening the 
VisualStatistics.exe file on the CD. This can be useful if 
your VS files have been corrupted and you want to run 
Visual Statistics without reinstalling VS.

On some computers the Visual Statistics Menu appears to 
have double images. This is known to occur with the ATI 
RAGE MOBILITY-P AGP2X graphics card in Windows 2000. If 
this occurs go to Display in your Control Panel and select 
the Settings tab. Press the Advanced button and make sure 
that the Font Size control is set at Small Fonts.  ATI is 
reported to know about this issue.

ADOBE READER 4.0
As part of the installation of Visual Statistics your 
computer will be searched for an Adobe Reader. If none is 
found, you will be asked if you want the Adobe 4.0 Reader 
installed. Answering YES will install the reader. If you 
choose NO you MUST install an Adobe Reader before Visual 
Statistics will be fully operational. It can be installed 
later by executing the ar405en.exe file in the Reader 
folder located in the visual statistics 2.2 folder on this 
CD or by going to www.Adobe.com on the World Wide Web. 

If an Adobe Reader is found, The Adobe Reader installation 
will be halted. However, you SHOULD check the version 
number of your Adobe Reader. Although Visual Statistics 
will work with Adobe Reader versions before 4.0, the 
clarity of graphics improved considerably in version 4.0 
and later. The 4.0 Reader can be installed by executing the 
ar405en.exe file in the Reader folder on this CD or by 
going to www.Adobe.com on the World Wide Web. IMPORTANT 
Uninstall the earlier version of the Adobe Acrobat Reader 
before installing the new version since Adobe changed the 
location where it stores the reader. Uninstalling the 
earlier version after installing the 4.0 Reader may make 
the 4.0 Reader inoperable. (This warning is from Adobe).

USING THE ADOBE READER
If you have not installed the Adobe Reader you will NOT be 
able to read the Visual Statistics Worktext and Solutions. 
When you are viewing a worktext chapter in the Adobe Reader 
you can jump to different sections of the chapter by using 
the bookmarks on the left. You can print any portion of the 
chapter or the entire chapter by pressing the printer icon 
on the toolbar at the top of the page. You can also copy 
any page or portion or a page by pressing the text icon (a 
capital T), highlighting the text and copying the text 
(select Copy from Edit on the Menu Bar or press Ctrl-C). 
This enables you to paste a page into a word processor and 
type your answers in the space provided.

Once you have opened a chapter’s worktext you can see the 
answers to the Learning Exercises by pressing the Show 
Solutions button.

POSSIBLE INSTALLATION PROBLEMS WITH THE ADOBE READER
If you are using the NT or Windows 2000 operating system, 
Adobe has reported to us that the Adobe Reader installation 
fails sometimes. Adobe has found that this is usually due 
to the computer’s anti-virus software. They suggest 
disabling the anti-virus software and reinstalling the 
Adobe Reader. After the Reader installation is complete, 
the anti-virus software can be enabled.

If you have installed Acrobat 3.0x (e.g., Adobe Acrobat 
Exchange, Distiller, Reader, etc.) the Adobe 4.0 Reader 
installation will inform you that problems will occur with 
the 4.0 Reader if the 3.0x product is uninstalled after 
installing the 4.0 Reader. To remedy these problems the 4.0 
Reader will have to be reinstalled. Therefore, it is 
recommended that any Adobe 3.0x product that you no longer 
need should be uninstalled BEFORE installing the Adobe 
Reader.

UNINSTALLING VS
Visual Statistics can be uninstalled in either of two ways: 
(1) press the Start button and select Uninstall Visual 
Statistics 2.2 from the Visual Statistics 2.2 folder in the 
Programs folder, or (2) use the Add/Remove Programs dialog 
box in the Windows Control Panel. This uninstall will NOT 
uninstall the Adobe 4.0 Reader even if it was installed by 
the Visual Statistics installation program.
