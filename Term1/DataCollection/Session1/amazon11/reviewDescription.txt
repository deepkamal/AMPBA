   I got all the accessories and original product... 
   Good phone even in 2018<br />I was andriod fan boy but now i doubt :)<br />Happy to have it. 
   Got my hands on my first iPhone and the experience has been great so far. Games run smoothly and the camera is top-notch. Beautiful display and body. iPhone 7p is the best apple phone you can get with the best features and storage. My only complain is that the battery runs out quite fast and I need to carry my power bank everywhere I go but I haven’t upgraded to iOS 12. 
   Using about 3weeks my opinion fot this iphone 7 plus is in really amazing ,i used early android os but now switching for android to ios ,its really worth to spend 44k in dis , best in class camera , great sound output and decent battery too, only thing which im also noticed that for some app or in charging d phone phone really heated . I dont know why some times it does heating and sometimes not, apart from this im really in beast mode to buy this phone.. 
   Good camera<br />Good battery life<br />Touch sensibility very smooth<br />5.5 hd display<br />4k videography<br />Quit disappoint about packing my package was tear but product box was good 
   I know in this price bracket there are several other options but why and who should consider to buy an iPhone 7 plus in 2020. Let's dig into the answer.<br />1. Build quality is exceptional. Unibody aluminium and glass front with precision finishing. Better from other android phones and more durable than glass back phones.<br />2. You know apple's iPad 10.2 which was launched in 2019 came out with the same chipset. A10 fusion chip. This is still capable enough and beleive me better than any Snapdragon 700 series processors. Even gives a tough competition to the 800 series. No lags no stutters nothing at all. OS is brilliantly optimised.<br />3. Iphone 7 plus will get ios 14 and 15. This phone is a long runner. You will get software support for next three years for sure. I hardly doubt any android would get the same treatment in this price range. Even iphone 6 series would get ios 14. Just imagine.<br />4. Battery backup is not extraordinary. But the OS is brilliantly optimised as I've told earlier. So you would get one day of back up for moderate to heavy use. You will get more than 5 hours screen on time on heavy usage, which is considered to be great in this time.<br />5. Camera is the only department where it lacks. You can expect good pictures in daylight condition with crisp details and decent quality. Low light performance is average. Takes decent selfies also. But in this era of megapixel counts I must be honest that iphone 7 plus doesn't deliver a stellar camera performance. So if this is your only zone of consideration I would suggest don't go for iphone 7 plus, as it is a decent performer but not an exceptional one.<br />6. If you're familiar to IOS then you know how good is this. So I would not elaborate this category. People who want to shift from Android, they won't be disappointed.<br />This was my honest opinion. Now you make the decision. Thank you. 
   Display scratch so is there any Chanses to replace ?? 
   I chose iPhone plus because I have low vision and found it difficult to read messages , mails in my iphone5s. I like the phone, silver in coliour . The picture quality is better than the previous versions. Now I am able to read mails, watch videos on the bigger screen.It  is a boon for persons like me having impaired vision. 
   I have used the iPhone se for an year and decided to jump the cannon with iPhone 7 plus. After searching and researching on various online platforms, I set my eye on this beast. To be truthfull I had to tweak my notifications, haptics and make other changes to make this phone last longer than 5 hours a day.<br /><br />Yet, I am not complaining!<br /><br />The phones clicks amazing pictures, especially at low light (you just need to know the camera lens and external lighting).<br /><br />Best buy for me during the big Indian shopping featival that Amazon held early October.<br /><br />All-in-all 5 star purchase. 
   A very good phone. You can update to iOS12. Its fast.<br /><br />I’m not an audiophile so the apple headphones are good enough for me. The adapter works well when I tried with my senheiser headphone. In my car I just plug the usb cable and it works. I could control like select playlist, change track form my inbuilt car stereo.<br /><br />Picture quality is awesome. I like that I can shoot raw.<br /><br />Battery last the whole day. 
   I have been using Apple iPhone 7Plus for last 18 months and there have been ZERO complaints so far. Though upgrades have come, I will be using it for at least another 18-24 months before moving to next-gen Apple product. 
   “The nice iPhone and original product . The product has Good battery a Life as Described, also Everything as Described and Design”.”Thank you “!!!!. Amazon for this Fulfillment on 31 May 2019. 
   Microphone worst quality 
   Nothing new to inform about iPhone. Wonderful phone and iOS. 
   My first iPhone. What an horrible experience! Microphone did not work for the first piece I got. Amazon sent me a replacement promptly. The replacement also had the same problem. I am taking it to the repair shop this weekend. Looks like  a whole batch of iPhones suffer from this issue.  I hope Apple takes a closer look at repair data and recalls defective models the way carmakers do. Never faced such issues with Samsung and Moto phones. 
   From the day one I'm facing Mike issue in the device apple people are playing with me I returned my device to service centre still it was pending I pay huge money for that device but I got very bad experience 
   I got Original Product and all the accessories EarPods with Lightning Connector and Lightning to USB Cable, 5W USB Power Adapter, Apple two stickers and documentation.<br />Thank you so much for Original Product "Appario Retail Private Ltd" and<br />Thank you so much for Amazon Tempered Secure Delivery.<br />Finger print response instantly<br />Awesome camera quality<br />Excellent battery life<br />Awesome display quality<br />I’m very happy to have my first IPhone 7 Plus I made good choice.<br />Thank you amazon for giving me an discount<br />I’m already recumended with my friends and family<br />They are waiting for but when price goes down 
   I bought this phone few months back , the performance of the phone is quite remarkable. You will get the output you paid for . The picture quality in daylight is really nice , should use the filters they have inbuilt in the camera . Battery life as of now is great one full charge works for a day , if you use social media for like 3-4 hrs in a day. 
   iPhone obviously have no comparison with any android phone. It’s processing time is so fast in low networks as well you will get amazed. This is my first one and looks to stick me with now. Really a good choice moving in. 
   Within 45 days battery life is 99%<br />Battery life sucks, Charger sucks, 12w charger costs 1500₹ and takes more than 2hrs to charge<br />Hardware has quality issues, could see micro gap between screen and body in 45days<br />Phone gets hot for games like angry birds 2, which is pathetic<br />And iPhone backup on iCloud sucks, it’s another Apple strategy to earn $$<br />No lightning to 3.5 adapter included, costs 1000₹<br />Made in India Apple products have serious quality issues.<br />Android to iOS migration is pain in but* have to use third party software like Dr. Phone 
   Did not likes it at all. 
   Good battery life, Easy maneuverability, Excellent camera quality.<br /><br />Apple as always, simplicity and elegance is embedded within the product. 
   Exactly one month after purchase, I found that the charger is not working . Since I had charger of my previous iPhone I somehow managed . But now I want my accessories to be replaced . 
   Phone is good.. 
   I’m really impressed with my new Apple iPhone 7 Plus. So far it’s performance is good enough to satisfy my expectations. Battery life is good, camera functions as per expectation, look wise it’s smart and trendy, technical specifications are as described. 
   Very good 
   Worst phone i have seen in my life.<br />Now Amazon is not replacing the phone after defect. 
   I git this phone after my iPhone 6 screen got destroyed. I got this at 37.9k (128GB model) specially because it does't have a notch (which absolutely hate). Great camera big screen mat black with matched antena bands almost looks like a back slab.<br /><br />slightly disappointed as there was no headphone to lightening converter was not included.  but overall extremely happy with it. I will be waiting for a notch-less iPhone before upgrading again and it looks like its going to hold up for another 4-5 years without any issues. 
   My VERDICT<br />It may not be the upgrade we were hoping for, but the iPhone 7 Plus is still an excellent phone with improved cameras, super slick performance and a handy waterproof, yet familiar design.<br /><br />FOR<br />Heaps of power for slick performance<br />Excellent camera<br />Solid battery life<br />AGAINST<br />Fairly expensive<br />Screen still only full HD<br />No headphone jack 
   Battery Life is OK,<br />1day Easy Go Battery with 2/3 hours of social media use,<br />Camera Quality in day such a quality like DSLR,<br />Smooth and simplycity experiance<br />in june 2019 i said that GO For IT,<br />such a quality<br />Im.android user but now IOS is Quality<br />Professional operating System 
   Heating issues, I will see if the prob persists then I will go for replacement. Seller appario! 
   Best phone I have used. Miss the 3.5 mm jack. Little heavy compared to non plus version. Good battery backup. 
   Both Cameras take nice pictures. Software Version ios11. Nicely packed. Sounds quality also great.<br />Will update further after one month use.<br /><br />Software updated to ios 12.1. Touch ID almost works 98% of the time.  No hanging of mobile till now.<br />iOS 13 upgraded. After upgrading, google chrome hangs upon opening pdf files. Rest no problem found till now.<br />Siri works perfect. 
   For the seller - phone is pretty good no issues but about packing worst even in iPhone box there was missing content like phone suppotive pannel also it was not original iphone packing it was opend already also phone was dead its shocking that phone was dead phone Battery was exausted . charging it was fine but in offer dont sell such products 
   I've been an iPhone user since 2012. The iPhone 7 plus 128 GB which i just bought at Amazon is an excellent value for money device for all my needs. The User interface of an iPhone is unmatched 
   Awesome product 👌🏻👌🏻 One of my best purchases from amazon. .. Amazon is trustworthy .. they deliver me best product at reasonable price.. I’m in Love vit my iPhone 7 Plus Rose Gold🥰🥰😀😀💃💃🤩🤩👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😃😃 
   Osm phone,and it is my first iPhone and I am too much impressed by the phone,the photos which is clicked by this phone gives me a dsrl type photo's feeling and it's battery easily carry a whole day without game play and heavy usage also,when u put the phone on your hand it's gives u a premium feeling and stylish look.and security is very tied than android and,allover it's a quality phone..👌👌👌✌️ 
   It is enmeshed my daughter completely! 
   very good product i bought the rose gold colour . But i assist tou to buy the jet black if you are a boy because jet black is amazing and very suitable for boy<br />amazon is recently sell the 128 gb in low range so iphone lover can buy iphone now easily 
   Better than iPhone 6S 
   The adapter attached to the charger isn’t working only after a month’s use.Utterly disappointed with the quality of the product.You expect to get a certain quality level in a product for which you pay close to 40,000/-!! I would like to contact the seller and expect a replacement of the charger ASAP or a partial refund from them. 
   SIM card tray is not closing well, 2mm projected outside like power button.. 5yrs old my 1GB RAM Apple 5S is working well than 3GB Apple 7plus, with rest to net browing speed.. Mobile data is not working most of the time.. Less price full of pain... 
   I purchased this mobile in July 2020. It's battery is draining very fast. Within 1-2hours it's power exhausted completely. It may be manufacturer defect. Worst experience. 
   Phone is too good after all Iphone is brand. But now facing some problem, sometime charging point is not working, after 3/4 tries then charge has started. I’m really worried about this. 
   Heating issues were found on this phone too much. Whenever I tried to watch videos on it it gets too much heat after 5 minutes.<br /><br />My money has been spent on this phone was wasted 
   Battery life is a concern<br />Also sound quality is very average during calls its bit difficult to hear the other sound and music quality sound is average 
   Got a good deal.37400 with no cost EMI.I let go of my XR for this.This is a premium handset.2 years old manufacturing date but phone is truly a masterpiece.As usual poor battery but otherwise a good product. 
   MOBILE IS GOOD ANY ONE PURCHES THIS 7PLUS  I GOT ORIGINAL APPLE PHONE IM VERY HAPPY WITH MY  MOBILE<br />THIS IS MY 2nd IPHONE AND  WROST PACKING  NO SAFETY FOR DEVICE 
   All are excellent, Apple iPhone is Apple iPhone, the name is enough, need not to say anything about that. 
   This iPhone is one of the best iPhone equivalent to iPhone 11. Running smooth in 2021. Go for 64 GB variant because 32 GB is little less. Playing games are very smooth on this iPhone. Camera is amazing. 
   Product look like refurbished as top speaker is covered with top glass of about 1mm(approx). If you see the image uploaded it will become clear about the top speaker covered.  Apart from that product is working fine as of now. 
   When i'm connecting my charger to phone, its showing as 'Charger accessory not supported'<br />And later I realized that this phone not worth for the money i paid. 
   Still the best phone to buy in 2019 
   iPhone 7 Plus is really a awesome. It’s picture quality compared to order is often more clear. Though Higher version are available in market but in this range it is justify. 
   Do not buy iphone from amazon. The product received was defective and i was not able to use for a day.  Since Amazon does not have a return policy, the product had to sent it for repair. Its always better to buy mobiles from the stores 
   Nice product 
   Best for camera Quality. Portrait Mode is awesome. Best phone around 60K. 6 hours battery life for internet usage and 12 hrs for phone call and messages. It can withstand for 2 hrs in 1 percent battery. 
   I’ve started using only from 19th December however my battery health has came down to 98% today which is really disappointing.  I really wanna have a chat with the seller . No excessive usage. 
   Using since 2.5 years & it does not hang a bit.. i don't have to see service center till date.. perfect ! 
   Nc phone with big screen overall good experience with new iphone<br />  Thanks Amazon for good deal<br />  😋😋👍 
   Picture is crisp, good battery life.<br />Its been almost an year I have been using this. No lag or any issues yet. Used extensively and high quality product 
   Very good phone ❤ 
   very good and like it 
   A little outdated. Better to go Oneplus under this sort of investment budget. 
   Very satisfied 
   quality is better then other phones,this in my first Iphone . this phone just gives you a different feeling from other phones, only one major issue that's is battery life. 
   Apple is always good to have.. if you looking to buy online trust amazon 
   It has been a year since i bought the phone.. as new as and interesting as i got from day 1.. perfect budget phone.  More worthy 
   Phone is not working condition. Power on problem. Apple is denied to serve at my location. Request to replace the product 
   Great phone.. solid build.. safe delivery. 
   Functionality is good and camera is very good as pictures never blurr<br /><br />I use for my professional works and I feel very happy. For this my laptop use get reduced

   iPhone is always the best smart phone 
   Experience a different way. No matter whether 2020 is going on, the good thing is that we buy Apple.  really its different feel as compared to android. 
   As much as i may write is less. This phone is feature packed. Brilliant camara. Top noch specs. Amazing look and feel. 
   Every thing is good expect battery life<br />I just love apple I phone 
   Coluour damage 
   Superb iPhone I like it 
   Its been the best phone purchase of all great battery life with full charge it can run upto 2 days the picture quality are great . 
   Battery life is poor , picture quality is bad in low light. 
   Undoubtedly apple 7 plus is still one of the best amongst all iPhones 
   Finger print unlock does not work 
   Received the defective iPhone, the phone was dead on arrival. went through lot of trouble due to return policy. 
   Awesome 
   Sir, Can you re-send the invoice with MY GST No. Added of this Product. It will be a help of you on me.<br /><br />My GSTIN No. 08ACXPJ6883F1ZU 
   Awesome product and genuine phone,100 % authentic product, thank you Amazon 
   The packaging bent the iphone box a bit 
   Ulty performance I really like it. Camer is very good, nice performance. Overall good product 
   Picture quality is very good. But not as good as they show in the ad. Probably I am not a good photographer. Sound quality is really good, gives 100% quality sound. 
   Very bad. I didnt get the lightening to 3.5 mm converter. It is written it will be inside the pack. But it was not there 
   My iPhone battery drained within 20 days, don’t buy from amazon, they have no return policy. I am trapped! 
   No issues at all, just be careful with the cover you choose as I used a really thin layer back cover which led to a lot of dot like scratches on the back panel. Apart from that, I’ve realised why apple is expensive and worthy of it too. 
   The phone was not starting. Amazon delivered me a defective phone and they are not even returning this product.<br />please don't buy this product 
   Good phone
